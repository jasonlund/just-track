When the Doctor asks if the Ood was behaving, clips of the Ood performing housework are shown including making the bed, dispensing Amy's laptop and Rory's lunch for their \"work day experience\", hanging up laundry and cleaning the windows. When Rory questions the Doctor on the Ood's belief he is their butler, he is reassured that the Ood is \"conditioned to serve\" and the best thing to do is to allow him to continue. The Doctor ends the phone call as there's trouble in the TARDIS and as the Ponds hear the Doctor battling with it, they discuss their guilt at the Ood's service.",

He tells them that he dropped the Ood off back home, rode a horse in 11th century Coventry and possibly invented pasta. He also says that he visited them once, but they weren't there. The Doctor then asks if they're all right; then, answering his own question, says that he's foolish to worry and \"The Ponds are always all right\". While saying this, a silent clip of Rory walking away from their house in anger is shown, as well as a clip of Amy walking after him, yelling \"I hate you\", and then crying. The next clip shows the Doctor saying goodbye; then he seems to change his mind, points the sonic screwdriver at the phone and deletes the message that he'd just left. We then see Amy walk inside her house, place some items down and walk up to the phone, seeing if there's a message, which there isn't. She then says that they need their \"raggedy man\", as she referred to him as in \"The Eleventh Hour\"; more specifically, that she, personally, needs the Doctor.",

On another world, the sound of gunfire and shouts of soldiers penetrate the mist...\r\n\r\n",
